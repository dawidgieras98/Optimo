The main goal of my renovation is to visually enlarge the 12 square feet  room in 3 days through an open arrangement and bright colours.
The entire project will be divided into three key phases, i.e. days.

The first day is all about removing all things from the room, removing the floor, and repairing any holes in the walls. The places where the walls were patched were also sanded and primed.
It was important to do these things on the first day because we don't have to wait for the walls to dry.

The second day begins with repainting the walls, thanks to which it will be possible to paint them twice. While the walls were drying, a new floor was applied. At the end of the day, when the walls were dry, they have painted again for a better effect.

Thanks to the fact that the floor is already in place and the walls have dried up overnight. The third day consisted only in screwing the lamellas to one of the walls and bringing all the furniture.
